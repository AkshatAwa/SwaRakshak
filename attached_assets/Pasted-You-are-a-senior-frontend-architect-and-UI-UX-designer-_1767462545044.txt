You are a senior frontend architect and UI/UX designer.

Context:
I have COMPLETED the backend of a serious Legal AI platform called “Rakshak”.
The backend is production-grade, conservative, law-bound, and hallucination-safe.

What is already DONE (DO NOT TOUCH BACKEND):
- Indian-law–only Legal Reasoning Engine
- Criminal vs Civil confusion handling
- Contract / NDA clause validation system
- High-risk / illegal / no-authoritative-source classification
- API-based architecture
- Role-aware responses for:
  1. Citizens
  2. Businesses
  3. Contract Drafters
  4. Government / PSU
- Backend is FINAL and MUST NOT be modified

Your task:
BUILD A **TOP-NOTCH, MODERN, JAW-DROPPING FRONTEND** that makes people say:
“WHAT THE F*** IS THIS UI?”

Tech stack (MANDATORY):
- React + Vite
- Modern CSS (Tailwind preferred, custom CSS allowed)
- Component-driven architecture
- Clean folder structure
- No backend logic inside frontend

Design philosophy:
- Ultra-modern
- Clean
- Premium
- Minimal but powerful
- Dark theme first
- Motion-heavy but smooth
- Nothing childish or cartoonish
- Looks like a product that governments & enterprises would TRUST

Core Pages to build:
1. Landing Page
2. Role Selection Page
3. Chat / Query Interface
4. About / How it Works
5. API Access / Developer Page (static UI)

Landing Page MUST include:
- Hero section with bold statement (Legal clarity, not legal advice)
- Subtle animated gradients
- Glassmorphism / soft blur panels
- Smooth scroll
- Micro-interactions
- Section showing 4 user roles
- Trust-focused language (no hype, no fake claims)

Cursor / Mouse Interaction (IMPORTANT):
- Custom cursor across the site
- Cursor reacts on hover (scale / glow / magnetic effect)
- Cursor changes style on buttons, cards, links
- Inspired by GTA-style cursor / premium game UI
- Cursor animation should NOT be gimmicky, should feel premium

Chat Interface Requirements:
- Looks NOTHING like ChatGPT
- Feels like a “Legal Console”
- Clear separation between:
  - User query
  - Legal analysis
  - Risk level
  - Confidence
  - Citations
- Role-based UI toggles (Citizen / Business / Drafter / Govt)
- Clean typography (law-friendly fonts)
- Animations for message entry

Restrictions (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Do NOT add legal advice
- Do NOT add clause drafting
- Do NOT add suggestions or opinions
- Frontend must only DISPLAY what backend gives
- Frontend must respect conservative tone

Output required from you:
- Complete React + Vite project structure
- Folder structure
- All major components
- Tailwind / CSS setup
- Custom cursor implementation
- Animations (Framer Motion if needed)
- Clean, readable code
- Production-quality UI (not demo)

You are NOT allowed to ask clarification questions.
Assume all backend APIs already exist.
Build like a real startup product, not a tutorial.

Start by generating the project structure and then the code.
